Research Paper-Ranking of generalized fuzzy numbers in fuzzy decision making using left and right transfer cofficients and areas by Vincent F. Yu, Ha Thi Xuan Chi , Luu Quoc Dat, Phan Nguyen Ky Phuc, Chien-wen Shen was implemented in matlab creating a GUI to Rank the alternatives by methods discussed in the above paper

This approach for ranking fuzzy numbers ensures full consideration for all
information of fuzzy numbers. Accordingly, an overall ranking index is
obtained by the integration of the information from the left and the right (LR)
areas between fuzzy numbers and the centroid points of fuzzy numbers.
This MCDM (Multi criterion decision making) approach does not require the
normalization process and thus avoids the loss of information results from
transforming generalized fuzzy numbers to normal form.
